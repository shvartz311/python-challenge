# python-challenge

Challenge:

I wrote a short story with the title "This is a short story !" and saved it in my Artifactory in the libs-release-local repository as a text file.

Someone hacked my account and renamed all my Artifacts in this repo.

Please help me to get my story back.
I want you to write a Python script to 
Go over the files in this repository
Create a CSV file with the details of the source file and the story.

File Name
Story Txt (without the title)

Security is even more important to me now and I limited all active users in the system with the minimum permissions that are needed.

Please work only with short-lived access tokens <5 seconds. You can refresh it if needed.

The script should print start and end time, and who makes the fastest run will get the first place prize !!!

You should use at least 10 advanced python concepts

This relies on a jfrog platform with admin user and password access.
JFrog Platform details
jfrog_url = "URL"
jfrog_user = "USER"
jfrog_password = "PASS"
Jfrog_repo_name = “REPO“



The script body should be like:
#!/usr/bin/env python3

< YOUR CODE > 


if __name__ == "__main__":

   start_time = perf_counter()

   < YOUR CODE > 


   end_time = perf_counter()
   print(f'It took {end_time-start_time: 0.4f} second(s) to complete.')



Share your instructions to execute and get the results.


Bonus: Share K8s Job to run it
